### üß© API Integration Note

This project integrates the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) using **Axios** to fetch and display Pok√©mon data dynamically.

Each Pok√©mon‚Äôs name, image, and type are retrieved from the `/api/v2/pokemon` endpoint with pagination support for smooth browsing.

The app also caches API responses using **AsyncStorage** to allow offline access and invalidates the cache every 24 hours for updated data.Additionally, pull-to-refresh and loading animations ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience on both Android and iOS.
